# SearchInArray
Create a program that says if a data belongs in a list that was previously created. 

The steps to take are: 
- Ask the user how many data will he enter. 
- Reserve space for that amount of numbers (floating point). 
- Request the data to the user 
- Later, repeat: 
  * Ask the user for a number (execution ends when he enters "end" instead of a number). 
  * Say if that number is listed or not.
